In Flutter, setting up **multiple pages with swipe navigation** is commonly done using a widget called `PageView`.

## üß≠ **Concept Overview: Swiping Between Pages in Flutter**

### ‚úÖ 1. **Use a `PageView` Widget**
- `PageView` is a built-in Flutter widget that allows **horizontal (or vertical)** swiping between child widgets.
- Each ‚Äúpage‚Äù is just a normal `Widget` (like a `Scaffold`, `Container`, or `Column`).

```dart
PageView(
  controller: _pageController,
  children: [
    FirstPage(),
    SecondPage(),
  ],
)
```

### ‚úÖ 2. **Use a `PageController`**
- A `PageController` lets you control or animate between pages programmatically.
- It‚Äôs optional if you're only relying on swipes, but helpful if you want to jump between pages with a button.

```dart
final PageController _pageController = PageController();
```

### ‚úÖ 3. **Define Each Page as a Widget**
- You can define each page inline or as separate widgets.
- Most commonly, each page is a `Scaffold` to give each one its own app bar and body.

```dart
PageView(
  controller: _pageController,
  children: [
    Scaffold(appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Page 1")), body: ...),
    Scaffold(appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Page 2")), body: ...),
  ],
)
```

### ‚úÖ 4. **Add Navigation Hints (Optional)**
- It's helpful to add small labels like ‚ÄúSwipe left to set rate‚Äù or icons so users know swiping is available.
